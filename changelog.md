**Improvements**:

- We’ve published our documentation at https://www.getampt.com/docs, so you can easily reference it for all your development needs.
- To make accessing our documentation even easier, we’ve added a link to the dashboard.
- Introducing the share command! This new feature lets you create previews of your work on a sandbox environment, allowing you to share your progress with the world while you continue to build.
- We’ve added the ability to define tasks using schedule.task and run them using schedule.at from API handlers at a specific date.
- You can now test your schedulers easily with our new feature that allows you to run schedulers from the dashboard for sandbox environments.
- We’ve adjusted the font size for the log details page on the dashboard to make it more readable.

**Bug Fixes**:

- We’ve resolved an issue where schedules defined using the cron() method weren’t showing up on the dashboard. This has now been fixed, so you can stay on top of your schedule with ease
